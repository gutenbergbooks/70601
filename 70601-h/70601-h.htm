  <p>Evidences of the existence of a prehistoric population in the Lower
    Mimbres Valley, New Mexico, have been accumulating for many years,
    but there is little definite knowledge of its culture and kinship.
    It is taken for granted, by some writers, that the ancient people of
    this valley lived in habitations resembling the well-known terraced
    dwellings called pueblos, many of which are still inhabited along the
    Rio Grande; but this theory presupposes that there was a close likeness
    in the prehistoric architectural remains of northern and southern New
    Mexico. It may be said that while there were many likenesses in their
    culture, the prehistoric inhabitants of these two regions possessed
    striking differences, notably in their architecture, their mortuary
    customs, and the symbolic ornamentation of their pottery.</p>

  <p>As the former inhabitants of the Mimbres Valley have left no known
    descendants of pure blood, and as there is a scarcity of historical
    records, we must rely on a study of archeological remains to extend our
    knowledge of the subject. Much data of this kind has already been lost,
    for while from time to time numerous instructive relics of this ancient
    culture have been found, most of these objects have been treated as
    "curios" and given away to be carried out of the country, and thus lost
    to science. Some of these relics belong to a type that it is difficult
    to duplicate. For instance, it is particularly to be regretted that the
    numerous votive offerings to water gods, including fossil bones, found
    when the "sacred spring" at Faywood near the Mimbres was cleaned out,
    have not been studied and described by some competent archeologist.
    The arrowheads, lance-points, and "cloud-blowers" from this spring
    are particularly fine examples, the most important objects of the
    collection being now in the cabinet of Mrs. A. R. Graham of Chicago.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

  <p>The valley of the Mimbres has never been regarded as favorable to
    archeological studies, but has practically been overlooked, possibly
    because of the more attractive fields in the regions to the north and
    west, so that only very meager accounts have been published.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

  <p>The present article, which is a preliminary report on an archeological
    excursion into this valley in May and June, 1914, is an effort to
    add to existing knowledge of the archeology of the valley. During
    this reconnaissance the author obtained by excavation and purchase a
    collection of prehistoric objects which have added desirable exhibition
    material to the collections in the U. S. National Museum.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Historical</span></h3>

  <p>The recorded history of the inhabitants of the Mimbres is brief. One
    of the earliest descriptions of the valley, in English, is found in
    Bartlett's "Personal Narrative," published in 1854. In his account of
    a trip to the copper mines at the present Santa Rita, Bartlett records
    seeing a herd of about twenty black-tailed deer, turkeys and other game
    birds, antelopes, bears, and fine trout in the streams. He <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>says very
    little, however, about antiquities, although he passed through a region
    where there are still several mounds indicating ruins. Bartlett writes
    (<i>op. cit.</i>, vol. 1, p. 218):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>On April 29, hearing that there were traces of an ancient Indian
      settlement about half a mile distant, Dr. Webb went over to examine
      it, while we were getting ready to move. He found a good deal of
      broken pottery, all of fine texture. Some of it bore traces of
      red, black, and brown colors. He also found a stone mortar about
      eight inches in diameter. I have since understood that this was the
      seat of one of the earliest Spanish missions; but it was abandoned
      more than a century ago, and no traces remain but a few heaps of
      crumbling adobes, which mark the site of its dwellings.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This ruin was situated near the Rio Grande, twenty-three miles from
    Mule Spring, on the road to the Mimbres. Bartlett does not tell us how
    he learned that this was an early mission site, but from the pottery it
    is evident that it was an "ancient Indian settlement."</p>

  <p>After having examined the configuration of the country through which
    Bartlett passed, and having compared it with statements in his
    description, the present writer thinks that Bartlett camped on May
    1, 1853, near the Oldtown ruin and that the place then bore the name
    Pachetehu. This camp was nineteen [eighteen?] miles from Cow Spring and
    thirteen miles from the copper mines.</p>

  <p>Bartlett records that he found, near his camp, "several old Indian
    encampments with their wigwams standing and about them fragments of
    pottery." Although not very definite, these references might apply
    either to the Oldtown ruin and some others a few miles up the river, or
    to more modern Apache dwellings.</p>

  <p>Mr. F. S. Dellenbaugh claims that Coronado, in 1540, passed through the
    valley of the Mimbres on his way to Cibola, and that this place was
    somewhere in this region, instead of at Zuñi, as taught by Bandelier
    and others. The present writer recognizes that the question of the
    route of Coronado is one for historical experts to answer, but believes
    that new facts regarding the ruins in the Mimbres may have a bearing
    upon this question and are desirable. While it can no longer be said
    in opposition to Dellenbaugh's theory that there are no ruins in the
    valley between Deming and the Mexican border, we have not yet been able
    to discover whether the ruins here described were or were not inhabited
    in 1540.</p>

  <p>The fragmentary notice of the ruins in the Upper Mimbres and Silver
    City region by Bandelier is one of the best thus far published,
    although he denies the existence of ruins now known in the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
    stretch of desert from Deming to the Mexican boundary. Regarding the
    ruins on the Upper Mimbres, Bandelier writes:<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Toward this center of drainage the aboriginal villages on the
      Rio Mimbres have gravitated as far south nearly as the flow of
      water is now permanent. They are very abundant on both sides of
      the stream, wherever the high overhanging plateaux have left any
      habitable and tillable space; they do not seem to extend east as
      far as Cook's Range, but have penetrated into the Sierra Mimbres
      farther north, as far as twenty miles from the river eastward....
      The total number of ruins scattered as far north as Hincks' Ranch
      on a stretch of about thirty miles along the Mimbres in the valley
      proper, I estimate at about sixty.... I have not seen a village
      whose population I should estimate at over one hundred, and the
      majority contained ten. They were built of rubble in mud or adobe
      mortar, the walls usually thin, with overwings, and a fireplace in
      the corner, formed by a recess bulging out of a wall. Toward the
      lower end of the permanent water course, the ruins are said to be
      somewhat extensive.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Professor U. Francis Duff, in an article on the "Ruins of the Mimbres
    Valley,"<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> adds a number of new sites to those mentioned above and
    contributes important additions to our knowledge of the prehistoric
    culture of the valley.</p>

  <p>Dr. Walter Hough, who compiled from Bandelier and Duff, and made use of
    unpublished information furnished by Professor De Lashmutt and others,
    enumerates twenty-seven ruins in the Silver City and Mimbres region
    to which he assigns the numbers 147–174. Many more ruins<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> might
    have been included in this list, but it is not the author's purpose,
    at this time, to mention individual pueblo sites but rather to call
    attention to the evidences of ruins in the Lower Mimbres Valley as an
    introduction to the study of pottery there collected. The ruin from
    which the majority of the bowls here considered were obtained does not
    appear to have been mentioned by Bandelier, Duff, or Hough.</p>

  <p>The last-mentioned author makes the following reference to figures
    on the pottery from the Mimbres region: "The decoration is mainly
    geometric. From the Mimbres he [Professor De Lashmutt] has seen a
    realistic design resembling a grasshopper, and from Fort Bayard another
    representing a four-legged creature. Mrs. Owen has a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>specimen from
    Fort Bayard bearing what is described as a 'fish design.'"<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Dr. Hough
    likewise points out that</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">pottery from some sites [ruins] is also different from that of
      any other [Pueblo] region and is affiliated, in some respects,
      with that of the Casas Grandes, in Chihuahua which lies in the low
      foot-hills of Sierra Madre. This is especially true in reference to
      fragments of yellow ware found here [the Florida Mountains] which
      in both form and color of decoration is manifestly like that of
      Casas Grandes.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The latest and thus far the most important contribution to our
    knowledge of the prehistoric people of the Mimbres we owe to Mr. C.
    L. Webster, who has published several articles on the antiquities of
    the Upper Mimbres, in "The Archæological Bulletin." He has made known
    several new village sites along the valley and has mentioned, for the
    first time, details regarding Mimbres ruins and the objects found in
    them. Practically nothing has thus far been recorded on the antiquities
    of the region immediately about Deming, nor of those south of that
    important railroad center to the Mexican border.</p>

  <p>In an article on "Some Burial Customs Practiced by the Ancient People
    of the Southwest,"<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Mr. Webster describes and figures a human burial
    on the Lower Mimbres not far from the "Military Post," situated near
    Oldtown. It was found in the plain some distance from any indications
    of prehistoric settlement. He says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>An exploration of it [a burial] revealed that originally a circular
      excavation, perhaps three feet in diameter and slightly more in
      depth, had been made in the ground; and afterwards the body placed
      at the bottom of this excavation in a sitting posture with the
      knees somewhat drawn up and arms to the side, and then a very large
      earthen olla, of a reddish color, was set over it, bottom side up,
      thus protecting it from the earth which was afterwards thrown in,
      filling up the excavation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Webster shows that the Mimbres aborigines did not always bury their
    dead in a contracted or seated posture. He speaks also of intramural or
    house burials in the valley of Rio Sapillo, a tributary of the Upper
    Gila, not far from the source of the Mimbres. In this region he dug
    down in one of the central rooms of a ruin about three feet below the
    surface, where he says (p. 73):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Near the bottom of this excavation hard red clay was encountered,
      which on opening up proved to contain the well-preserved skeleton
      of an adult person <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>which had been placed at length on its back
      with arms at its side. Over the face of this one [human burial]
      had been placed a rather large shallow dish, through the bottom
      of which a hole about the size of a five cent piece, or a little
      larger, had been carefully drilled. This hole was so located as to
      occupy a position between the eyes when placed over the face. This
      body was resting on a bed of red clay like that which had covered
      it. Near the first body was a second body which had been buried in
      exactly the same way, and had a similar perforated dish over its
      face. Under this first or upper tier of bodies a second tier of
      bodies was discovered which had been buried exactly the same way
      as the upper tier—each one resting separate and alone, though near
      together, each one tightly enveloped in stiff red clay.</p>

    <p>All the vessels placed over the faces showed the action of fire,
      and it was plain to be seen they had once been used in cooking....
      The method practised here was to first spread down a layer of red
      plastic clay, then lay the body upon it, place the perforated dish
      over the face and finally plaster all with a covering of the same
      clay. This same method was followed in every case observed.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Sites of Ruins in the Lower Mimbres Valley</span></h3>

  <p>The portion of the Sierra Madre plateau called Lower Mimbres, or
    Antelope Valley, extends from where the Mimbres sinks below the
    surface at Oldtown to Lake Palomas in Mexico, twenty-five miles south
    of Deming. According to some writers this region has no prehistoric
    ruins, but several of the beautiful specimens described and figured
    in the present article came from this valley, and there are doubtless
    many others, equally instructive, still awaiting the spade of the
    archeologist. The purest form of the Mimbres prehistoric culture is
    found in the lower or southern part of this plain, but it extends into
    the hills far up the Mimbres almost to its source.</p>

  <p>The plateau on which the prehistoric Mimbres culture developed is
    geographically well marked, and distinguished from other regions of the
    Southwest geographically and biologically, facts reflected in human
    culture. The cultural gateway is open to migrations from the south
    rather than from the east, north, or west.</p>

  <p>The evidences drawn from the poor preservation of the walls of the
    ruins, and the paucity of historical references to them, instead of
    indicating absence of a prehistoric population suggest the existence
    of a very ancient culture that had been replaced by wandering Apache
    tribes years before the advent of the Spaniards. Chronologically the
    prehistoric people belongs to an older epoch than the Pueblo, and its
    culture resembles that which antedated the true Pueblos.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

  <p>The ruins here considered do not belong to the same type as those of
    the Lower Gila and Salt, although they may be contemporaneous with
    them, and may have been inhabited at the same time as those on the
    Casas Grandes River in northern Chihuahua. Not regarded as belonging to
    the same series of ruins as those on the Upper Gila and Salt rivers,
    they are not designated numerically with them.</p>

  <p>Although the indications of an ancient prehistoric occupancy of the
    Mimbres are so numerous, they are so indistinct and have been so
    little studied that any attempt here to include all of them would be
    premature. Remains of human occupancy occur in the plain about Deming,
    and can be traced northward along the river east and west into the
    mountains, and south into Mexico.</p>

  <p>The author has observed many evidences of former settlements along the
    Upper Mimbres which have not yet been recorded. The indications are, as
    a rule, inconspicuous, appearing on the surface of the ground in the
    form of rows of stones or bases of house walls, fragments of pottery,
    and broken stone implements, such as metates and manos. These sites are
    commonly called "Indian graves," skeletons often having been excavated
    from the enclosures outlined by former house walls. There are also
    evidences of prehistoric ditches at certain points along the Mimbres,
    showing that the ancients irrigated their small farms.</p>

  <p>No attempt is made here to consider all the ruins of the Mimbres or of
    the Antelope plain in the immediate neighborhood of Deming, but only
    those that have been visited, mainly ruins from which the objects here
    described were obtained.</p>

  <p>Although few of the walls of the ancient buildings rise high above
    ground, they can be readily traced in several places. From remains that
    were examined it appears that the walls were sometimes built of stone
    laid in mortar and plastered on the inside, or of adobe strengthened at
    the base with stones and supported by logs, a few of which have been
    found in place upright. No differentiation of sacred and secular rooms
    was noticed, and no room could be identified as belonging to the type
    called kiva. The floors of the rooms were made of "caleche," hardened
    by having been tramped down; the fireplace was placed in one corner, on
    the floor, and the entrance to the room was probably at one side. To
    all intents and purposes these dwellings were probably not unlike those
    fragile wattle-walled structures found <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>very generally throughout the
    prehistoric Southwest, and supposed to antedate the communal dwellings
    or pueblos of northern New Mexico.</p>

  <p>The two aboriginal sites in the Mimbres Valley that have yielded the
    majority of the specimens here figured and described are the Oldtown
    ruin and the Osborn ruin, a small village site twelve miles south
    of Deming and four miles west of the Florida Mountains. There are
    some differences in general appearance and variations in the minor
    archeological objects from these two localities, but it is supposed
    that specimens from both indicate a closely related, if not identical,
    culture area.</p>

  <p>About a year ago Mr. E. D. Osborn, of Deming, who had commenced
    excavation in these ruins,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> obtained from them a considerable
    collection of pottery and other objects. His letters on the subject
    and his photographs of the pottery, sent to the Bureau of American
    Ethnology, first led the author to visit southern New Mexico to
    investigate the archeology of the Mimbres.</p>

  <h4>VILLAGE SITE NEAR OSBORN RANCH<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></h4>

  <p>A few extracts from Mr. Osborn's letters regarding this site form a
    fitting introduction to a description of the sites and the objects from
    them:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>At the present time [December 8, 1913] the nearest permanent water
      to this place [site of the cemetery] is either the Palomas Lake
      in Mexico, twenty-five miles south, or thirty miles north, where
      the Mimbres River sinks into the earth.... This supposed Pueblo
      site is situated upon a low sandy ridge which at this point makes
      a right-angle bend, one part running south and the other west from
      the angle. The top and sides of the ridge, also the "flat" enclosed
      between the areas of the ridge, to the extent of about an acre, is
      littered all over with fragments, charcoal and debris containing
      bones to the depth of from one to three feet. There are also a
      great many broken metates and grinding stones.... In digging on top
      of this ridge, near the angle, we occasionally found what appeared
      to have been adobe wall foundations, but not sufficiently large
      to determine the size or shape of any building. In digging on the
      ridge a few stone implements were found, including one fine stone
      axe, stone paint pots and mortars, and a few arrowheads, also two
      bone awls and a few shell beads and bracelets, the last all broken.
      The only article of wood was the stump of a large cedar post full
      of knots, badly decayed; it had been burned off two or three
      inches below the surface of the ground. The cemetery was found on
      the inner slope of the angle facing the southwest.... In a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>large
      proportion of cases the body was placed upon its back, feet drawn
      up against the body, knees higher than the head; sometimes the head
      was face up and sometimes it was pressed forward so the top of the
      head was uppermost. In other interments the body was extended its
      full length with face up. A large majority of the skulls had a
      bowl<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> inverted over them, though I judge twenty per cent were
      without any bowl.... In a great many instances after the body had
      been placed in the grave with bowl over the head, a little soil was
      filled in, and about one foot of adobe mud was added and tramped
      down then filled up with soil. This adobe mud is almost like rock,
      making it difficult to dig up the bowl without smashing it.... No
      article of any kind except the bowl over the head was found in any
      grave. In one case a bowl was found with a skull under it and under
      that skull was another bowl and another skull.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Few evidences of upright walls of buildings are found at or near
    this site. The surface of the ground in places rises into low mounds
    devoid of bushes, which grow sparingly in the immediate neighborhood,
    but no trees of any considerable size were noticed in the vicinity.
    Before work began at this place the only signs of former occupancy
    by aborigines, besides walls, were a few broken fragments of ancient
    pottery, metates, or a burnt stump protruding here and there from the
    ground. None of the house walls projected very high above the surface
    of the ground. Excavations in the floors of rooms at this point yielded
    so many human skeletons that the place was commonly referred to as
    a cemetery, but all indications support the conclusion that it was
    probably a village site with intramural interments.</p>

  <p>The human burials here found had knees flexed or drawn to the breast
    in the "contracted" position, sometimes with the face turned eastward.
    The skeletons were sometimes found in shallow graves, but often were
    buried deeply below the surface. Almost without exception the crania
    had bowls fitted over them like caps. The graves as a rule are limited
    to soft ground, the bowls resting on undisturbed sand devoid of human
    remains. In some instances there appears to have been a hardened
    crust of clay above the remains, possibly all that is left of the
    floor of a dwelling. The indications are that here, as elsewhere, the
    dead were buried under the floors of dwellings, as is commonly the
    case throughout the Mimbres Valley. While there is not enough of the
    walls above ground to show the former extent <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>of the dwellings, the
    indications are that they were extensive and have been broken down and
    washed away.</p>

  <h4>OLDTOWN RUIN</h4>

  <p>Near where the Mimbres leaves the hills and, after spreading out, is
    lost in the sand, there was formerly a "station," on the mail route,
    called Mimbres, but now known as Oldtown. Since the founding of Deming,
    the railroad center, the stage route has been abandoned and Mimbres
    (Oldtown) has so declined in population that nothing remains of this
    settlement except a ranch-house, a school-house, and a number of
    deserted adobe dwellings.</p>

  <p>Oldtown lies on the border of what must formerly have been a lake and
    later became a morass or cienega, but is now a level plain lined on one
    side with trees and covered with grass, affording excellent pasturage.
    From this point the water of the Mimbres River is lost, and its bed is
    but a dry channel or arroyo which meanders through the plain, filled
    with water only part of the year. In the dry months the river sinks
    below the surface of the plain near Oldtown reappearing at times where
    the subsoil comes to the surface, and at last forms Palomas Lake in
    northern Mexico.</p>

  <p>In June, when the author visited Oldtown, the dry bed of the Mimbres
    throughout its course could be readily traced by a line of green
    vegetation along the whole length of the plain from the Oldtown site to
    the Florida Mountains.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

  <p>The locality of emergence of the Mimbres from the hills or where
    its waters sink below the surface is characteristic. The place is
    surrounded by low hills forming on the south a precipitous cliff,
    eighty feet high, which the prehistoric inhabitants chose as a site
    of one of their villages; from the character and abundance of pottery
    found, there is every reason to suppose this was an important village.</p>

  <p>The Oldtown ruin is one of the most extensive seen by the author during
    his reconnaissance in the Deming Valley, although not so large as some
    of those in the Upper Mimbres, or on Whiskey Creek, near Central.
    Although it is quite difficult to determine the details of the general
    plan, the outlines of former rectangular rooms are indicated by stone
    walls that may be fairly well traced. There seem to have been several
    clusters of rooms arranged in rows, separated by square or rectangular
    plazas, unconnected, often with circular depressions between them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span></p>

  <p>There is considerable evidence of "pottery hunting" by amateurs in
    the mounds of Oldtown, and it is said that several highly decorated
    food bowls adorned with zoic figures have been taken from the rooms.
    It appears that the ancient inhabitants here, as elsewhere, practised
    house burial and that they deposited their dead in the contracted
    position, placing bowls over the crania (<a href="#i01">fig. 1</a>).<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp58" id="i01">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i013.jpg" alt="skeleton in pit">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>—Urn burial. (Schematic.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The author excavated several buried skeletons from a rectangular area
    situated about the middle of the Oldtown ruin, surrounded on three
    sides by walls. The majority of the dead were accompanied with shell
    beads and a few turquoise ornaments, and on one was found a number of
    shell tinklers made of the spires of seashells. One of the skeletons
    excavated by Mr. Osborn appeared to have been enclosed in a stone
    cist with a flat slab of stone covering the skull. The remains of a
    corner post supporting the building stood upright on this slab.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
    In another case a skull was found broken into fragments by the large
    stone that had covered it. Several skeletons had no bowls <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>over the
    heads, an exceptional feature in Mimbres burials; and in some instances
    the bowl had been placed over the face. In the case of numerous infant
    interments the bowl covered the whole skeleton.</p>

  <h4>RUIN ON BYRON RANCH</h4>

  <p>This ruin lies not far from the present course of the Mimbres near
    the Little Florida Mountains. The place has long been known as an
    aboriginal village site and considered one of the most important in
    the valley. The remains of buildings cover a considerable area. They
    have a rudely quadrangular form, showing here and there depressions and
    lines of stones, evidently indicating foundations of rooms, slightly
    protruding from the ground. Although this ruin has been extensively
    dug over by those in search of relics, no systematic excavations seem
    to have been attempted. It is said that valuable specimens have been
    obtained here, and fragments of pottery, arrowheads, and broken stone
    implements are still picked up on the surface.</p>

  <p>The important discovery of burial customs of the ancient Mimbreños was
    made by Mr. Duff at this ruin. He excavated below the floor of one of
    the rooms and found a human cranium on which was inverted a food bowl
    pierced in the middle, the first example of this custom noted in the
    Mimbres region.</p>

  <h4>RUIN NEAR DEMING</h4>

  <p>About seven miles northwest of Deming, in a field on the north side of
    the Southern Pacific Railroad, there is a small tract of land showing
    aboriginal artifacts strewn over the surface, affording good evidence
    of prehistoric occupation. There are no house walls visible at this
    place, and only a few fragments of food bowls, but in the course of an
    hour's search several small mortars (<a href="#i02">fig. 2</a>), paint grinders and other
    objects were procured at this place.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

    <img class="illowp28" src="images/i014.jpg" alt="">

  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

  <h4>PREHISTORIC SITE NEAR BLACK MOUNTAIN</h4>

  <p>Walls and outlines of rooms indicated by rows of stones mark remains
    of a prehistoric settlement at the base of Black Mountain, eight or
    nine miles northwest from Deming. Here occur many fragments of pottery,
    broken metates, and manos, and other indications of occupation by man.
    On top of Black Mountain there are rude cairns or rings of stones
    apparently placed there by human hands.</p>

  <p>The fragments of pottery taken from the ruin at the base of Black
    Mountain are very different from those from Oldtown and other typical
    Mimbres ruins. Its color on the outside is red, with a white interior
    surface decorated with black geometric designs, the border is flaring
    often with exceptional exterior decoration. These bowls have broken
    encircling lines—a feature yet to be found in other Mimbres pottery—and
    none of the few pieces yet obtained from the ruin near Black Mountain
    has animal pictures. The whole appearance of this pottery recalls old
    Gila ware and suggests an intrusion from without the Mimbres region,
    possibly from the north and west.</p>

  <p>The circles of stones on the top of Black Mountain have many points of
    resemblance to similar structures on hilltops near Swarts' Ranch on the
    Upper Mimbres, described by Mr. Webster, as follows:<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The tops of nearly all the mountains of this valley, and
      particularly those here mapped, are occupied by hundreds of rock
      mounds, breastworks, pits, etc. The region shown in plate 3, and
      which represents an area about one mile in length and three-fourths
      mile in width, exhibits 240 of these structures.... These rock
      mounds are composed of more or less rounded rocks gathered from
      the region, and generally weighing from four to eight pounds each;
      although many are smaller: and again others weigh from twenty-five
      to fifty pounds or more each. These structures are generally
      circular: although at times they are ovate, and again assume an
      oblong or linear marginal outline. They vary considerably in size,
      although usually being only from three to four feet in diameter:
      the linear ones being from six to eight feet or more in length.
      Some of the larger circular mounds assume a diameter of seven to
      eight feet. The height of these mounds varies considerably; but as
      a rule assume a height ranging from one to one and a half feet.</p>

    <p>The distance apart of these structures is variable; being as a
      general thing from five to fifteen feet; but not infrequently they
      are only two to four feet apart: at other times, however, they may
      be observed to be from sixty to ninety feet or more distant from
      each other.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

  <p>Mr. Webster discovered on a rocky ridge near Swarts' ruin, somewhat
    higher on the Mimbres than Brockman's Mill, seven similar earthen
    pits of much interest, which remind the author of subterranean or
    half-sunken dwellings. They are saucer-shaped or linear depressions,
    averaging about two feet in depth; when circular they are from five to
    fifteen feet in diameter the linear form in one instance being fifty
    feet long. Some of these have elevated margins, others with scarcely
    any marginal ridge. The western margin in one instance has a "wall of
    rounded stones."</p>

  <p>There are similar saucer-shaped depressions near Brockman's Mills and
    elsewhere in the Mimbres, almost identical with "pit dwellings" found
    by Dr. Hough near Los Lentes. These saucer-like depressions, often
    supposed to have been the pits from which adobe was dug, were also
    places of burial, the dead being presumably interred under or on the
    floors; the original excavation being a dwelling that was afterwards
    used as a burial place for the dead. Their form suggests the circular
    kiva of the Pueblos and has been so interpreted by some persons.</p>

  <h4>RUINS ON THE MIMBRES RIVER FROM OLDTOWN TO BROCKMAN'S MILLS</h4>

  <p>On low terraces elevated somewhat above the banks of the river,
    between Oldtown and Brockman's Mills, there are several village sites,
    especially on the western side.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> The most important of these is
    situated about four miles north of Oldtown. The ruin at the Allison
    Ranch, situated at the Point of Rocks where the cliffs come down to the
    river banks, is large and there are many pictographs nearby. The ruins
    at Brockman's Mills on the opposite or eastern side of the river lie
    near the ranch-house. Many rooms, some of which seem to have walls well
    plastered, can be seen just behind the corral. North of the ruin is a
    hill with low lines of walls like trincheras. On some of the stones
    composing these walls and on neighboring scattered boulders, there are
    well-made pictographs.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

  <h4>PICTOGRAPHS</h4>

  <p>Pictographs occur at several localities along the Mimbres. As these
    have a general likeness to each other and differ from those of other
    regions, they are supposed to be characteristic of the prehistoric
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>people. They are generally pecked on the sides of boulders or on
    the face of the cliffs in the neighborhood of prehistoric sites of
    dwellings. Although there is only a remote likeness between these
    pictographs and figures on pottery, several animal forms are common to
    the two.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp58" id="i03">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i017.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>—Pictographs.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The most important group of pictographs (<a href="#i03">fig. 3</a>) seen by the author
    are situated about nine miles from Deming in the western foot-hills of
    Cook's Peak.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Some of the pictographs recall decorations on bowls
    from Pajarito Park.</p>

  <p>Another large collection of Mimbres pictographs, visited by the author,
    is found at Rock Canyon, three or four miles above Oldtown, at a point
    where the cliffs approach the western bank of the river. On the river
    terrace not far above this collection of pictures, also on the right
    bank of the river, lies the extensive ruin of a prehistoric settlement,
    the walls of which project slightly above the surface. This ruin has
    been dug into at several points revealing several fine pieces of
    pottery, fragments of metates, and other implements, which are said to
    have been found in the rooms. A mile down the valley overlooking the
    river there is another cluster of pictures at a ruin called "Indian
    graveyard," probably because human skeletons have been dug out of the
    floors of rooms.</p>

  <h4>MORTARS IN ROCK IN PLACE</h4>

  <p>One of the characteristic features of the Mimbres ruins, but not
    peculiar to them, are mortars or circular depressions worn in the
    horizontal surface of rock in place. They are commonly supposed to
    have been used as mortars for pounding corn, and vary in size from two
    inches to a foot in diameter, being generally a foot deep. We find
    them occurring alone or in clusters. Good examples of such depressions
    are found near the Byron ruin, in the neighborhood of the ruins along
    Whiskey Creek, at Oldtown, and elsewhere. There is a fine cluster of
    these mortars nine miles from Deming, near the pictographs in the
    Cook's Range. Similar mortars have been repeatedly described and often
    figured. Mr. Webster has given the most complete account of this type
    of mortars in a description of the ancient ruins near Cook's Peak.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
    On the surface of the southwestern <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>point of a low hill to the north of
    an ancient ruin at Cook's Peak, according to this observer,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">occurs a feature which the writer had nowhere else seen, save on
      the east side of the same mountain. I refer to the great number
      of mortars which occur in this sandstone back a few feet to the
      north of the ruins, and which were made and long used by the
      ancient pueblo-dwellers. There exists at this one place fifty-three
      of these mortars, nearly all of them occurring in an area of
      surface not more than seventy-five or eighty feet in diameter....
      Nearly all the mortars are circular or sub-circular in outline,
      symmetrical and smooth inside, and the upper edge or margin usually
      rounded by the pestle. In a few cases, however, these mortars have
      an oblong or subovate outline, somewhat like some forms of metates
      found among the ruins.</p>

    <p>These mortars often contract to a point at the bottom, when
      circular in marginal outline, although at times are longer than
      broad, as just stated, and in this case have a more flattened
      bottom. They vary from two to eleven inches in diameter, the
      smallest forms being those apparently only just begun, and are few
      in number. The deepest mortar observed was seventeen inches, though
      the great majority of them would vary perhaps from four to ten
      inches in depth. Often the rock was smooth and polished around the
      margin of the mortars, and [their distances apart] vary from a few
      inches to several feet from each other.</p>

    <p>At times these mortars would be located on the top of a large block
      of sandstone which might happen to occupy this area; these boulders
      sometimes being four to five feet in diameter and perhaps four feet
      in height. It was plain to be seen that this ancient mill-site was
      long used by these peculiar people, but just why so many quite
      similar mortars should have been made here and used by these people
      is a matter of conjecture.</p>

    <p>It seems certain that a sufficiently large number of people could
      not have been congregated here, under ordinary conditions, to
      warrant the forming of so many mortars for the purpose of grinding
      food.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The present writer accepts the theory that these rock depressions
    were used in pounding corn or other seeds, but their great number in
    localities where ruins are insignificant or wanting is suggestive.
    We constantly find arable land near them, indicating that communal
    grinding may have been practised, and suggesting a large population
    living in their immediate neighborhood, which may have left no other
    sign of their presence.</p>

  <h4>MINOR ANTIQUITIES</h4>

  <p>The artifacts picked up on the surface near ruins or excavated from
    village sites resemble so closely those from other regions of the
    Southwest that taken alone these do not necessarily indicate special
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>culture areas. A few of the more common forms from the Mimbres are
    here figured for comparison, but, with the exception of the pottery,
    there is little individuality shown in the majority of these objects.
    Among other objects may be mentioned stone implements, mortars, idols,
    bone implements, shell ornaments, and pottery.</p>

  <h4>STONE IMPLEMENTS</h4>

  <p>The stone axes are not very different from those of the Rio Grande and
    the Gila, but it is to be noticed that they are not so numerous as
    in the latter region, and are probably inferior in workmanship, fine
    specimens indeed being rare. The majority of the axes (<a href="#i04">fig. 4</a>) are
    single grooved, but a few have two grooves. In Dr. Swope's collection,
    now in the Deming High School, there is a fairly good double-bladed axe.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Miss Alnutt, of Deming, has a remarkable collection of arrowpoints
    gathered from many localities in the valley, and also a few fine
    spearpoints, conical pipes, and other objects taken from the sacred
    spring at Faywood Hot Spring. A beautiful arrow polisher found near
    Deming is shown in <a href="#i05">figure 5</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

  <p>The pipes from the Mimbres take the form of tubular cloud-blowers,
    specimens of which are shown in <a href="#i06">figure 6</a>. Apparently these pipes were
    sometimes thrown into sacred springs, but others have been picked up on
    the surface of village sites or a few feet below the surface.</p>

    mortars with a handled projection on one side is shown in <a href="#i07">figure 7</a>.
    This specimen is in the Swope collection in the Deming High School.
    In the same collection there are also two beautiful tubular pipes, or
    cloud-blowers, from the same spring.</p>

    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>—Handled mortar. (Swope collection.)
      Length 10¾″.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The stone mortars from Mimbres ruins vary in size. Many are simply
    spherical stones with a depression on one side; others are larger but
    still spherical, or ovate; while others have square or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> rectangular
    forms. The most remarkable feature in these is the presence of a handle
    on one side, which occasionally is duplicated, and in one instance four
    knobs or legs project from the periphery. These projections appear to
    characterize the mortars of the Mimbres, although they are not confined
    to them, as the form occurs in other regions of New Mexico and in
    California. One of the most instructive of these small spherical paint
    mortars, now owned by Mr. E. D. Osborn, has ridges cut in high relief
    on the outside.</p>

  <p>Metates and manos, some broken, others whole, are numerous and can be
    picked up on almost every prehistoric site. While some of these metates
    are deeply worn, showing long usage, others have margins but slightly
    raised above the surface. The majority of metates found on the sites of
    habitations have no legs, but a typical Mexican metate with three knobs
    in the form of legs was presented to the National Museum by the Rev.
    E. S. Morgan, of Deming. Metates are sometimes found in graves with
    skeletons, presumably those of women. Several ancient metates are now
    in use as household implements in Mexican dwellings.</p>

  <p>If the size of the population were to be gauged by the number of
    mortars and manos found, certainly the abundance of these implements
    would show that many people once inhabited the plain through which
    flows the Mimbres River. Narrow, flat stone slabs have an incised
    margin on one end. Their use is problematical. The frequency of stone
    balls suggests games, but these may have been used as weapons; or
    again, they were possibly used in foot races, as by the Hopi of to-day.</p>

  <h4>COPPER OBJECTS</h4>

  <p>Native metallic copper was formerly abundant at the Santa Rita mines,
    and there is every probability that the material out of which some of
    the aboriginal copper bells were made was found here, and that these
    mines were the source of float copper found in Arizona ruins. Although
    no copper implements were found by the author in the Mimbres ruins, he
    has been told that objects of copper apparently made by the aborigines
    have been found in some of the graves.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

  <h4>STONE IDOLS</h4>

  <p>The author saw several stone idols that were reported to have been
    obtained from ruins in the Mimbres Valley. These idols represent frogs
    (<a href="#i08">fig. 8</a>), bears, mountain lions, and other quadrupeds, and have much
    the same form as those from ancient ruins in Arizona.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> On the backs
    of several of these stone idols are incised figures, like arrowheads
    tied to Zuñi fetishes, or possibly rain-cloud figures. In one instance
    they were made on an elevated ridge, which unfortunately was broken.
    The author has also seen several small amulets, perforated apparently
    for suspension. The stone idols here figured (figs. <a href="#i08">8</a>, <a href="#i032">9</a>, <a href="#i010">10</a>) were
    presented to the Deming High School by Dr. Swope.</p>

  <h4>SHELL BRACELETS AND CARVED SHELLS</h4>

  <p>Two or three shell bracelets were excavated from Mimbres ruins, and
    there were also found carved shells and tinklers not unlike those of
    northern New Mexico ruins. Some of these when excavated were found
    near the head and are supposed to have been earrings. Five shell rings
    were still on the bones of the forearm of a child when found. One of
    the shell bracelets owned by Mr. Osborn was cracked but was pierced on
    each side of the break, indicating where it had been mended; another
    had figures incised on its surface, and a third had the edges notched,
    imparting to it a zigzag shape, like that of a serpent. Many shell
    beads, spires of shells used for tinklers, and other shell objects, all
    made of genera peculiar to the Pacific Ocean, were found during the
    excavations.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Pottery</span></h3>

  <h4>FORMS AND COLORS</h4>

  <p>The comparatively large number of vases, food bowls, and other forms
    of decorated smooth ware in collections from the Mimbres is largely
    due to their use in mortuary customs, and the fact that almost without
    exception they were found placed over the skulls of the dead. Although
    the largest number of vessels are food bowls, there are also cups with
    twisted handles (<a href="#i011">fig. 11</a>), bowls (<a href="#i012">fig. 12</a>), vases, dippers, and other
    ceramic forms found in pueblo ruins.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

  <div class="col50">

    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>—Small bowl. Diam. 3½″.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </div>

  <p>Coarse, undecorated vessels showing coils, indentations, superficial
    protuberances, and other rude decorations like those so well known in
    Southwestern ruins, are well represented. Some of these were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>used as
    cooking vessels, as shown by the soot still adhering to their outer
    surface. While the majority of bowls were broken in fragments when
    found, a few were simply pierced through the bottom; one or two were
    unbroken or simply notched at the edge.</p>

  <p>The colors of Mimbres ware are uniform and often striking. There are
    good specimens of black and white ware; also red, black, and yellow
    with brown decorations are numerous. Some of the best pieces are
    colored a light orange. Many of the fragments are made of the finest
    paste identical in color and finish with ware from Casas Grandes,
    Chihuahua, which furnishes the best prehistoric pottery from the
    Southwest. No effigy jar, or animal formed vase, however, exists in any
    collections from the Mimbres examined by the author.</p>

  <p>Ruins in the Lower Mimbres have thus far yielded a larger variety and
    a finer type of pottery than ruins on the banks of the river among the
    hills, which is in part due to the extent of excavations. The Oldtown
    potters developed a kind of pottery with characteristic ornamentation
    found both in ruins in the plain to the south and along the narrow
    valley of the Mimbres to the north.</p>

  <p>The Mimbres pottery, like all other ancient ware from the Southwest,
    frequently shows evidences of having been mended. Holes were drilled
    near the breaks and fibers formerly united the parts thus holding
    the bowl together even though broken. As one goes south, following
    the course of the river, the character of the pottery changes very
    slightly, but if anything is a little better.</p>

  <p>The food bowls generally have a rounded base, but one specimen is flat
    on the bottom. The edges of the bowls from the ruin at Black Mountain
    are curved outward, an exceptional feature in ancient Pueblo vessels
    but common in modern forms.</p>

  <h4>PICTURES ON MIMBRES POTTERY</h4>

  <p>The great value of the ceramic collection obtained from the Mimbres
    is the large number of figures representing men, animals, and
    characteristic geometrical designs, often highly conventionalized,
    depicted on their interiors. These figures sometimes cover a greater
    part of the inner surface, are often duplicated, and are commonly
    surrounded by geometrical designs or simple lines parallel with the
    outer rim of the vessel. It is important to notice the graceful way
    in which geometrical figures with which the ancient potters decorated
    their bowls are made to grade into the bodies of animals, as when
    animal figures become highly conventionalized into geometrical designs.
    Although these decorations are, as a rule, inferior to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span> those of the
    Hopi ruin, Sikyatki, the figures of animals are more numerous, varied,
    and realistic.</p>

  <p>The ancients represented on their food bowls men engaged in various
    occupations, such as hunting or ceremonial dances, and in that way have
    bequeathed to us a knowledge of their dress, their way of arranging
    their hair, weapons, and other objects adopted on such occasions. They
    have figured many animals accompanied by conventional figures which
    have an intimate relation to their cults and their social organization.
    Although limited in amount and imperfect in its teaching this material
    is most instructive.</p>

      collection.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <h4>GROUP OF HUNTERS</h4>

  <p>An instructive group of human figures is drawn on a deep red and white
    food bowl (<a href="#i013">fig. 13</a>), which measures ten inches in diameter. It is
    evident that this design represents three hunters following the trail
    of a horned animal, probably a deer. This trail is represented on the
    surface of the bowl by a row of triangles, while the footprints of the
    hunters extend along its side. It may be noted that although there are
    three hunters, the trails of two only are represented, and that the
    hunters are barefoot. They have perhaps lost the trail and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> are looking
    the opposite way, while the animal has turned back on his path. The
    footprints of the deer in advance of the hunters are tortuous, showing
    want of decision on the part of the animal. The three hunters are
    dressed alike, wearing the close-fitting jacket probably made of strips
    of skin woven together like that found by Dr. Hough in a sacrificial
    cave at the head of the Tulerosa, New Mexico. Each carries a bow and
    arrow in his right hand, and in his left a stick which the leader uses
    as a cane; the second hunter holds it by one end before him, and the
    third raises it aloft. These objects are supposed to represent either
    weapons or certain problematic wooden staffs with feathers attached,
    like divining rods, by which the hunters are in a magical way directed
    in their search. The first hunter "feels" for the lost trail by means
    of this rod.</p>

  <p>An examination of the pictures of the arrows these hunters carry shows
    that each has a triangular appendage at the end representing feathers,
    and small objects, also feathers, tied to its very extremity. The hair
    of the third hunter appears to be a single coil hanging down the back,
    but in the other two it is tied in a cue at the back of the head. The
    eyes are drawn like the eyes on Egyptian paintings, that is, the eye as
    it appears in a front view is shown on the side of the head. The right
    shoulders of all are thrown out of position, in this feature recalling
    primitive perspective. The information conveyed by this prehistoric
    picture conforms with what is known from historical sources that the
    Mimbres Valley formerly abounded in antelopes, and we have here a
    representation of an aboriginal hunt.</p>

  <h4>FIGURE OF A WOMAN</h4>

  <p>A black and white bowl (<a href="#i01_1">pl. 1, fig. 1</a>) is twelve and one-half inches
    in diameter and six inches deep. Upon this bowl is drawn a figure of a
    human being, probably a woman or a girl, seen from the front. Although
    portions of the figure are not very legible, such details as can be
    made out show a person wearing a blanket that extends almost to the
    knees leaving arms and legs bare, the lower limbs being covered. The
    head is square, as if masked, with hair tied at each lower corner.
    Although these appendages may be meant to represent ear-pendants, it
    is more likely that they are whorls of hair, as is still customary
    in Pueblo ceremonies in personations of certain maidens. Across the
    forehead are alternating black and white square figures arranged in
    two series, recalling corn or rain-cloud symbols. The neck is adorned
    by several strands of necklaces, the outermost of which, almost
    effaced, suggests rectangular ornaments. The garment worn by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
    figure is evidently the ceremonial<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> blanket of a Pueblo woman, for
    no man wears this kind of garment. It has a white border and from
    its middle there hangs a number of parallel lines representing cords
    or a fringe, evidently the ends of a sash by which the blanket was
    formerly tied about the waist. It is instructive to notice that we
    find similar parallel lines represented in a picture of a girl from
    Sikyatki<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> where the blanket has the same rectangular form as in the
    prehistoric Mimbres picture. There can be no question that in this
    case it represents a garment bound with a girdle, or that the picture
    was intended for that of a girl or a woman. We have in this picture
    evidence that the same method of arranging the hair was used in the
    Mimbres Valley as in northern New Mexico. The leg wrappings suggest
    those used by Pueblo women, especially the Hopi, whose leggings are
    made of long strips of buckskin attached to the moccasins and wound
    around the lower limbs.</p>

  <h4>PRIEST SMOKING</h4>

  <p>The third human figure, found on a black and white bowl from a
    Mimbres ruin, is duplicated by another of the same general character
    depicted on the opposite side of the bowl. These figures (<a href="#i014">fig. 14</a>) are
    evidently naked men with bands of white across the faces. The eyes are
    represented in the Egyptian fashion. In one hand each figure holds a
    tube, evidently a cloud-blower or a pipe, with feathers attached to
    one extremity, and in the other hand each carries a triangular object
    resembling a Hopi rattle or tinkler. The posture of these figures
    suggest sitting or squatting, but the objects in the extended left hand
    would indicate dancing. The figure is identified as a man performing a
    ceremonial smoke which accompanies ceremonial rites.</p>

  <h4>MAN WITH CURVED STICK</h4>

  <p>One of the most instructive food bowls found at Oldtown, now owned by
    Mr. Osborn, has on it a picture of two hunters, one on each side of
    an animal (<a href="#i015">fig. 15</a>). One of these hunters carries in his hand a stick
    crooked at the end, its form suggesting a throwing stick.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Both
    hunters have laid aside their quivers, bows, and arrows, which are
    shown behind them. The picture of an animal between them has been so
    mutilated by "killing" or breaking the bowl that it is impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
    to identify it. From the end of this crook to the body of the animal
    there extend two parallel lines of dots indicating the pathway of a
    discharged weapon. Near the body of the animal these rows of dots take
    a new direction, as if the weapon had bounded away or changed its
    course. The rows of dots are supposed to represent lines of meal by
    which Pueblos are accustomed to symbolically indicate trails or "roads."</p>

  </figure>

  <p>There is, of course, some doubt as to the correct identification of
    the crooked staff as a throwing stick, for as yet no throwing stick
    has been found in the Mimbres ruins. The resemblance of the crooked
    stick to those on certain Hopi altars and its resemblance to emblems
    of weapons carried by warrior societies is noteworthy. Crooked sticks
    of this character have been found in caves in the region north of the
    Mimbres.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

  <p>We find a survival of a similar crook used as sacred paraphernalia in
    several of the Hopi ceremonies, where they play an important rôle.
    As the author has pointed out, crooked sticks or gnelas (<a href="#i016">fig. 16</a>)
    identified as ancient weapons surround the sand picture of the Antelope
    altar in the Snake Dance at Walpi, and in Snake altars of other Hopi
    pueblos, but it is in the Winter Solstice Ceremony, or the Soyaluña,
    at the East Mesa of the Hopi, that we find special prominence given to
    this warrior emblem. During this elaborate festival every Walpi and
    Sitcomovi kiva regards one of these gnelas as especially efficacious
    for the warriors, and it is installed in a prominent place on the kiva
    floor, as indicated in the author's account of that ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

  <p>The following explanation of these crooks was given him by the priests:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>These crooks or gnelas have been called warrior prayer sticks, and
      are symbols of ancient weapons. In many folk tales it is stated
      that warriors overcame their foes by the use of gnelas which would
      indicate that they had something to do with ancient war implements.
      Their association with arrows on the Antelope altars adds weight to
      this conclusion.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The picture from Oldtown ruin of the hunter who has laid aside the
    quiver, bow, and arrow, and is using a similar gnela,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> corroborates
    this interpretation.</p>

  <p>Not all crooked sticks used by the Hopi are prayer sticks, or weapons,
    for sometimes in Hopi ceremonials a number of small shells are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>tied to
    the extremity of a crooked stick forming a kind of rattle. In the Flute
    Ceremony a crooked stick is said to be used to draw down the clouds
    when the rain they contain is much desired.</p>

  <p><a href="#i016">Figure 16</a> is a representation of one of the crooks which was specially
    made for use in the Soyaluña at Walpi, in 1900. Similar crooks were
    set upright in a low mound of sand on the floors of all the kivas.
    Extending from the base of the crook to the ladder there was sprinkled
    a line of meal called the road (of blessings), over which was stretched
    a feathered string attached to the end of the crook. Midway in the
    length of the crook was attached a packet of prayer meal wrapped in
    cornhusk and a feather of the hawk, a bird dear to warriors, and other
    objects, which indicated a prayer offering. At the termination of
    ceremonies in which these crooks are made and blessed as prayer emblems
    by the Hopi they are deposited in shrines as recorded.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

  <p>The crook (gnela) is used as a prayer emblem of warriors because it has
    the form of an ancient weapon, and while it assumes modifications in
    different Hopi ceremonies it apparently has one and the same intent,
    as in Soyaluña. This crook is sometimes interpreted as symbolically
    representing an old man with head bent over by age, but this
    interpretation is probably secondary to that suggested above, as so
    often happens in the interpretations given by primitive priests.</p>

  <p>The true interpretation of the crooked prayer stick was pointed out by
    the author in his article on "Minor Hopi Festivals,"<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This crook is believed by the author to be a diminutive
      representation of an implement akin to a throwing stick, the object
      of which is to increase the velocity of a shaft thrown in the air.
      Its prototype is repeatedly used in Hopi rites, and it occurs among
      Hopi paraphernalia always apparently with the same or nearly the
      same meaning.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In <a href="#i017">figure 17</a> is represented a person running with outstretched banded
    arms, holding in the left hand a bow, and in the other a straight
    stick. The head is circular with cross lines, a round, dotted eye, and
    two triangular ears. Another representation shows a human figure with

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

  <p>By far the most unusual group of human forms consists of two figures,
    one male, the other female, depicted on another bowl. The action in
    which these two are engaged is evident. The female figure has dependent
    breasts and wears a girdle. One hand is raised and brought to the face
    and the other carries a triangular object. The female figure has three
    parallel marks on the cheek, like the Hopi war-god. Behind the woman
    are several curved lines depicting unidentified objects.</p>

  <p>The figure shown on one bowl (<a href="#i018">fig. 18</a>) has several marked features, but
    the author is unable to suggest any theory of identification. It seems
    to be a seated figure with a human head, arms, and legs, the toes and
    fingers being like hands and feet. The forearm is drawn on the shoulder
    in the same way as in the one of the hunters (<a href="#i013">fig. 13</a>). The eye, nose,
    and mouth are also human, but the body is more like that of an animal.
    The appendages back of the head are similar to those interpreted as
    feathers on the heads of certain animal designs.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>On the theory that this is a seated human figure it is interesting
    to speculate on the meaning of the curved object represented on the
    surface of the bowl, extending from one hand to the foot. This object
    has the general form of a rabbit stick or boomerang, still used by the
    Hopi in rabbit hunting.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

  <p>The well-drawn figure painted on a bowl (<a href="#i01_2">pl. 1, fig. 2</a>) from Oldtown
    ruin represents a man with knees extended and arms raised as if
    dancing. This picture has characteristic markings on the face, but
    otherwise is not distinctive.</p>

  <h4>QUADRUPEDS</h4>

  <p><em>Wolf.</em>—Although there are not sufficiently characteristic
    features represented in the next figure (<a href="#i02_1">pl. 2, fig. 1</a>)<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> to identify
    it satisfactorily, the form of the head, tail, mouth, and ears suggests
    a wolf.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The square design<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> covering one side of the body seems
    to the author not to belong to the animal itself, for an Indian who
    could represent an animal as faithfully as those here pictured would
    not place on it such markings unless for a purpose. It resembles the
    small blankets sometimes worn by pet dogs or horses among white people,
    which is a lame explanation, as dog and horse blankets were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>unknown
    among Indians. The only theory the author has formed regarding this
    geometrical figure is that it is a variant of the Sikyatki habit of
    accompanying a figure of an animal with a representation of his shrine.
    This bowl is of black and white ware and is eleven inches in diameter
    by five and one-half inches deep.</p>

  <p><em>Antelope.</em>—There are two<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> figures of an animal with branching
    horns,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> supposed to be an antelope, an animal formerly common in
    Mimbres Valley. In one of these (<a href="#i019">fig. 19</a>) the head is held downward
    as if the animal were feeding; in the other (<a href="#i020">fig. 20</a>) the neck is
    extended. A pair of markings on the neck are identical with those on
    pictures of the antelope still painted on modern pottery made by the
    Zuñi. A band, resembling a checkerboard, is drawn across the body of
    one; on the other are parallel lines.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>Another figure referred to as an antelope appears to represent a young
    fawn, since, while it has all the characteristics of this animal, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>the
    horns are wanting. This specimen (<a href="#i021">fig. 21</a>) was found at Oldtown. The
    rectangular shape so often given to the bodies of animals drawn on
    Mimbres pottery is well shown in this specimen.</p>

  </figure>

  <p><em>Mountain Sheep.</em>—It is evident from the form of the unbranched
    horns, the slender legs, and the head, that either a mountain sheep or
    mountain goat was intended to be represented in <a href="#i02_2">plate 2, figure 2</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span> The
    markings on the body are symbolic, suggesting lightning, and it may
    be added that the Hopi depict the lightning on the artificial horns
    mounted on caps and worn by them in presentations of dances in which
    they personate mountain sheep.</p>

  <p><em>Rabbit or Hare.</em>—The pictured representation (<a href="#i031">fig. 31</a>) of a
    quadruped whose hindlegs are larger than the forelegs and whose long
    backward extending ears are prominent features, probably represents a
    rabbit or a hare. The eyes recall figures of birds depicted on bowls
    from the Little Colorado ruins in Arizona, where eyes are depicted on
    one side of the head in violation of a law of perspective in which only
    one eye can appear on a lateral view. The figure appears to have a tuft
    of grass in the mouth. The geometric markings on the body are different
    from those of any known species of rabbit and belong to the category of
    symbolic designs.</p>

  <p>The author excavated at Oldtown a food bowl, the figure on which was
    undoubtedly intended for a rabbit (<a href="#i022">fig. 22</a>). The head, ears, body,
    legs, and tail are well made, leaving no question of the intention of
    the artist; but if there were any doubt of the identification it is
    dispelled by the representation of the mouth, on which the sensitive
    hairs or bristles are represented.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

  <p><em>Mountain Lion.</em>—One of the Oldtown bowls is decorated with a
    representation of the wild cat or mountain lion, and is a fair example
    of archaic design (<a href="#i023">fig. 23</a>). The feature that distinguished this
    quadruped is the position of the tail which, like those of Pueblo
    pictures of mountain lions or cats, is bent forward over the back.</p>

  <p>Both head and body are rectangular and the legs are short and stumpy
    with sharp curved claws. The ears, mouth, and teeth have characteristic
    features of carnivora and the tail is banded, especially near the end.</p>

  <p>The geometric design on the side of the body consists of an angular,
    S-shaped design with two equal armed stars, the latter associated with
    the mountain lion in Pueblo symbolism. The single figure drawn on this
    bowl occupied the middle of the interior, but in the next bowl this
    figure is duplicated.</p>

  <p>The two figures on another bowl also represent some cat, or mountain
    lion, but the geometric figure on its body differs so much from the
    first specimen that it may belong to a different genus. The geometrical
    designs occur on both the anterior and posterior extremities of the
    rectangular body and consist of triangular figures with parallel lines
    and terraces recalling rain-clouds. This bowl is owned by Mr. E. D.
    Osborn, and was found at Oldtown. The decorations on the two quadrants
    alternating with the animal figures are bands from which other markings
    radiate to the side of the bowl.</p>

  <p><em>Badger.</em>—The quadruped drawn on the inside of a bowl found at
    Oldtown, and now owned by Mr. E. D. Osborn, has some resemblances
    to a badger, especially in the head, ears, teeth, and tail. The
    geometrical design on the body of this animal consists of an unequal
    sided rectangle enclosing four triangles with angles so approximated
    as to form an enclosed rectangle. The head has two bands extending
    longitudinally, apparently conventionalized markings characteristic of
    this animal, as they do not occur on deer, wildcats, or mountain sheep.</p>

  <p><em>Birds.</em>—As has been pointed out in the author's
    identifications<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> of designs on Sikyatki pottery, those representing
    birds are among the most abundant. The same holds also in the pottery
    from the Mimbres, where several figures identified as birds occur on
    food bowls. Two of these are duplicated on the same vessel, practically
    the same figure being repeated on opposite sides. In the latter
    case each member of the pair faces in an opposite direction or is
    represented as if moving with the middle of the bowl on the left.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

  <p>The various birds differ considerably in their forms, organs,
    attitudes, and appendages. Two of the pictures seem to represent the
    same bird, but the others belong to different genera. There are one
    or two figures in which feathers can be distinguished, but as a rule
    they are fewer in number and the feathers less conventionalized than in
    Sikyatki pottery.</p>

  <p>Pending the difficulty in identifying the various designs representing
    birds, they are designated by letters A, B, C, D, etc.</p>

  <p><em>Bird A.</em>—The figure shown in <a href="#i03_1">plate 3, figure 1</a>, is represented
    by two designs, practically the same, repeated so far as appendages
    go, but quite different in the ornamentation of their bodies. One of
    these has the same geometrical figure on its body as on one of the
    quadruped pictures, the second has a different design. Both birds have
    wings outspread as if in flight, in which the feathers are well drawn
    in detail, especially the wing on the side turned toward the observer.
    That on the opposite side is simply uniformly black. The feathers of
    its companion on the other side of the bowl are indicated by parallel
    lines. The tail is long and forked at the extremity, suggesting a
    hawk, and is decorated for two-thirds of its length with cross-hatched
    and parallel lines. A triangular appendage arises from the under side
    of the tail at the point where the line decoration ends, forming an
    appendage which is likewise represented in the companion picture.</p>

  <p><em>Bird B.</em>—Bird B (<a href="#i03_2">pl. 3, fig. 2</a>) is painted on the interior of
    a food bowl of black and white ware, ten inches in diameter by five
    inches deep. Its body is oval, the head erect and undecorated, and the
    tail twisted from a horizontal into a vertical plane as is customary
    in representation of lateral views of birds from Pueblo ruins. The
    geometric figure on the body is unfortunately somewhat obscured by the
    plaster used in mending, but several parallel bars that may represent
    feathers of the wings show through it, and a number of other designs or
    parallel lines are apparent. An appendage of triangular form hangs from
    the lower margin of the body and indicates the position of one leg; the
    other leg is missing.</p>

  <p><em>Bird C.</em>—Bird C, shown in <a href="#i04_1">plate 4, figure 1</a>, occurs on a black
    and white bowl that measures ten inches in diameter, five and one-half
    inches in depth. The figure occupies the circular zone in the middle
    of the bowl and is enclosed by parallel lines which surround the bowl
    near the rim. The top of the head, which is globular, is white in
    color, the beak projecting and the eyes comparatively large. The body
    is likewise globular and is covered by a square geometrical design the
    details of which are considerably obscured by the hole in the middle
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> the jar. A number of parallel lines of unequal length, turned
    downward, hang from the rear of the body and form the tail. The long
    legs suggest a wading bird, and the widely extended claws point to the
    same identification.</p>

  <p><em>Bird D.</em>—One of the most instructive figures of birds occurs on a
    bowl from Oldtown ruin. This bowl (<a href="#i024">fig. 24</a>) is now owned by Mr. E. D.
    Osborn, by whom it was found. The bird depicted on it is seen from the
    back; its wings are drooping, and parallel lines indicate feathers. The
    legs, drawn backward, terminate in three toes, and the tail, slightly
    bent to one side, is composed of several feathers.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i024">

      collection.)</div>
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The head is globular with two eyes on the back and a short pointed
    beak. As in all other zoic figures the geometric figures on the back
    of the body are the most characteristic. The middle of the body is
    occupied by an oval design through which may be seen the perforation
    with which the bowl was killed. At one end there is a triangular design
    with cross lines which extend partly over the oval figure where, except
    at one point, they are obscure.</p>

  <p>Four quadrilateral designs are distributed at intervals around the
    oval figure. Each of these has sides of about equal length and a dot
    medially placed in a smaller figure contained in a larger.</p>

  <p><em>Bird E.</em>—The bird shown in <a href="#i023">figure 25</a> (p. 35) from the Osborn
    ruin has a body form not unlike that of <a href="#i04_1">plate 4, figure 1</a>, but the
    geometric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> design on the body, although rectangular, has incurved
    sides and is covered with cross lines suggesting a net. Its neck is
    girt by four rings, head small, without feathers, eye minute, bill
    comparatively long and pointed recalling that of a snipe which is also
    suggested by long legs and in a measure by the form of the tail.</p>

  <p>This bird is undoubtedly aquatic, as indicated by the figure of a fish
    which it appears to be on the point of capturing or devouring.</p>

  <p><em>Bird F.</em>—The bird shown in <a href="#i04_2">plate 4, figure 2</a>, is different from
    any of the above and is distinguished readily by the four curved lines
    on the head suggesting the quail. The pointed tail is marked above
    and below with dentations, formed by a series of rectangular figures
    which diminish in size from body attachment to tip. The body itself is
    marked posteriorly with parallel lines, rectangular and curved figures
    suggesting wings.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter" id="i026">

    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>—Bird G. Oldtown Ruin. (Osborn
      collection.) Diam. 10″.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The bowl (<a href="#i026">fig. 26</a>) has three animals figured upon it forming a
    graceful combination. The most striking represents a long-billed bird
    with one wing notched on the inner margin. The tail of this bird is
    differently drawn from any of the other birds in the collection and has
    representations of six feathers. In front of this bird, with the point
    of the snout at the tip of the bill of the bird, is a lizard-shaped
    head covered with scales and two round eyes. The other remarkable
    figure also has extended forelegs, but the body is so broken that
    identification is quite impossible. Like the figure of the lizard, it
    also has a lozenge head and two eyes. The geometrical designs on the
    body are characteristic.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

  <h4>ANIMALS NOT IDENTIFIED</h4>

  <p><em>Unidentified Animal.</em>—It is difficult to tell exactly what animal
    was intended to be represented by that shown in <a href="#i05_2">plate 5, figure 2</a>.
    Its head and mouth are not those of any of the horned animals already
    considered, although it has some anatomical features recalling a
    mountain sheep. The extension back of the body has a remote likeness
    to a fish, but may be a bird or simply a conventional design. The
    geometrical figure covering the side of the body bears some likeness
    to one depicted on a bird, as shown in <a href="#i03_1">plate 3, figure 1</a>. The same
    geometrical figure sometimes also occurs separated from any animal form
    in Sikyatki pottery.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

  <p>The bowl is ten inches in diameter, five inches in depth, and the
    figures are painted red on a white ground.</p>

  <p><em>Unidentified Animal.</em>—One of the most remarkable of many figures
    on bowls from Oldtown in the collection of Mr. E. D. Osborn is shown
    in figures <a href="#i027">27</a>, <a href="#i024">29</a> (p. 38). Three colors enter into the decoration
    of this bowl, black, white, and brown, and there are two types of
    ornamentation, one zoic, the other geometric. The bowl itself was much
    broken when found, but not so mutilated as to hide the main designs.</p>

  <p>The zoic figures represent animals with square bodies, four legs, ears,
    head, and tail like a young antelope. There is no design on the side
    of the body, but in its place four broad parallel bands extend from
    the belly across the bowl. Each group of parallel lines changes its
    direction, widening in their course or near the ends where they enlarge
    for the accompanying figure. The markings on the necks of these figures
    suggest those on fawns.</p>

  <p>The elaborate geometric figure composed of a scroll and comma-like dot
    and eye is a highly conventionalized symbol, possibly of some animal,
    as a bird's head, common on Casas Grandes pottery.</p>

  <p>There is a bowl on exhibition in the Chamber of Commerce at Deming
    with a picture of a quadruped resembling a deer, but the base is so
    fractured in killing that it is difficult to determine the shape of the
    body or its decoration.</p>

  <p><em>Unidentified Animal.</em>—One of the most instructive figures of the
    collection appears in duplicate on a large food bowl (<a href="#i05_1">pl. 5, fig. 1</a>).
    This vessel is black and white in color and measures fifteen inches
    in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>diameter by six inches deep. The two designs occur on the two
    sides of the interior of the bowl, the middle of which is left without
    decoration.</p>

  <p>The body of this creature is elongated and tapers backward, being
    continued into a tail like that of the lizard. The head is long and the
    snout pointed. Only two legs are represented, and these are situated
    far back on the body near the point of the origin of the tail from the
    body. A lozenge-shaped symbol forms the geometrical design on the side.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="i027">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i043.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>—Unidentified animal. Oldtown Ruin.
      (Osborn collection.)</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The presence of only two legs in this figure would seem to indicate
    that a bird was intended, but no bird has a tail like this figure; and
    the prehistoric potters of the Mimbres certainly knew how to draw a
    bird much better than this would imply. The exceptional features of
    this drawing, doubtless intentional, belong neither to flesh, fish, nor
    fowl, rendering its identification doubtful.</p>

  <h4>GRASSHOPPER<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></h4>

  <p>A figure on a bowl here represented (<a href="#i06_1">pl. 6, fig. 1</a>) is painted in
    "black or brown on a background of bluish wash over a yellow color."
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>This bowl is eleven inches in diameter, five inches in depth. The
    figure is a remarkable one, having features of several animals, but
    none of these are more pronounced than its insectiform characters,
    among which may be mentioned the antennæ, three legs on one side
    (evidently three pairs of legs, for that in the back is simply
    introduced in violation of perspective), and an extended segmented
    abdomen attached to the thorax and terminating in a recurved tip. The
    character of the appendages to the thorax, or the wings, leaves no
    doubt that a flying animal was intended, and the legs and head being
    like an orthopterous insect, it may be provisionally identified as a
    "grasshopper."<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

  <p>While the general form of head, thorax, and body appear from an
    inspection of the figure, it may be well to call attention to certain
    special features that illustrate primitive methods of drawing. The
    most striking of these is seen in the abnormal position of the leg
    which arises from the thorax on the back in the rear of the so-called
    wings. This abnormal position was introduced by the artist to show
    the existence and form of the legs on the right side; the appendage
    corresponds with one of the three on the left side, which have the
    proper position but are much smaller. A similar delineation of organs
    out of place not seen or turned away from the observer was common among
    the prehistoric artists of the Pueblo region and is paralleled by the
    representation of two eyes on one side of the head already mentioned.
    The two "wings," each ending in white circles with dots or crosses, are
    supposed, on the theory that this is a grasshopper, to represent wing
    covers or elytra, which of course the prehistoric people of the Mimbres
    did not differentiate from folded wings. It is possible that wing cover
    and wing may be represented on one side and that corresponding organs
    on the right side of the body are omitted. The thorax is covered with
    regularly arranged rows of dots formed by parallel lines crossing at an
    angle, forming purely arbitrary decoration representing the geometric
    designs on the bodies of other animals.</p>

  <h4>FROGS AND BIRDS</h4>

  <p>One of the few bowls obtained on which animals of two species were
    depicted on the same vessel was excavated by the author at Oldtown.
    This remarkably fine specimen (<a href="#i07_1">pl. 7, fig. 1</a>) has figures of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>two birds
    and two frogs<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> drawn in opposite quadrants, being unique in this
    particular. The two birds and frogs are not very unlike those already
    described but have certain characteristic features, especially in the
    geometric designs on their bodies.</p>

  <p>The bowl is warped into an irregular shape and made of thin ware,
    probably distorted in firing. It was found under the floor of one of
    the central rooms in the Oldtown ruin, almost completely covering the
    skeleton of a baby.</p>

  <p>On another bowl (<a href="#i06_2">pl. 6, fig. 2</a>) there is depicted a frog very like that
    last mentioned. The frog being an amphibian was undoubtedly greatly
    reverenced by the ancient people of the Mimbres Valley.</p>

  <h4>HORNED SNAKE</h4>

  <p>The serpent with a horn on the head is pretty generally regarded as a
    supernatural being, and its pictures and effigies occur on modern Hopi,
    Zuñi, and other Pueblo paraphernalia. It is an ancient conception, for
    it is figured on prehistoric pottery from all parts of the Pueblo area,
    having been found as far south as Casas Grandes in Chihuahua. It is to
    be expected that a people like the ancient Mimbreños who adorned their
    pottery with so many well drawn zoic figures would have included the
    horned serpent, provided this reptile was a member of their pantheon.
    The nearest approach to a figure of such a monster is found on a large
    pottery fragment found by Mr. Osborn twelve miles south of Deming.
    This fragment covered the cranium of a skeleton and was perforated or
    "killed" like a whole bowl.</p>

  <p>A very large number of pictures of the horned snake from localities all
    over the Southwest might be mentioned, but a few examples are adequate
    to show how widespread the conception was in ancient times. They occur
    among the Tewa, Keres, Zuñi, Hopi and other Pueblos and vary greatly in
    details, but in all instances preserve the essential symbolic feature—a
    horn on the head and a serpentine body.</p>

  <p>The horned serpent is known to the Hopi as the plumed serpent, and
    when represented by them has a bundle of hawk feathers as well as a
    horn attached to the head. Effigies of this being, also with horn <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>and
    feathers, are used in several ceremonies, as the Winter Solstice,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
    and a dramatic festival<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> which occurs yearly in March. Wooden
    representations of the same horned snake are carried as insignia by a
    warrior society called the Kwakwantu,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> in the New Fire Ceremony. The
    priests of the Tewan pueblo, Hano, among the Hopi also have effigies
    of the horned snake, the worship of which their ancestors brought to
    Arizona from New Mexico. These effigies are yearly made of clay and
    form conspicuous objects on the December altars of that pueblo.</p>

  <p>The head shown in <a href="#i028">figure 28</a> has a horn curving forward almost identical
    with that on the head of a horned serpent on a bowl from Casas Grandes
    in the Heye collection. Its gracefully sinuous body is decorated
    with alternating geometric figures, curves and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>straight lines.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
    Accompanying the figure of a serpent is a well-drawn picture of a
    turtle which is decorated on the carapace with a rectangular area on
    which is painted a geometric figure recalling that on bodies of birds
    and some other animals.</p>

  <h4>FISHES</h4>

  <p>One of the bowls (<a href="#i030">fig. 30</a>) from the Oldtown ruin has two fishes
    depicted on opposite sides of the inner surface. These fishes resemble
    trout and are of different colors, black and reddish brown figures
    painted on a white ground. They are represented as hanging from two
    parallel lines surrounding the rim of the bowl. These fishes are so
    well drawn that there is no doubt what animal was intended to be here
    represented. On the interior of another bowl excavated by the author
    at Oldtown there is a picture of a fish which recalls the two <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>just
    mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> It may be mentioned that fishes are not represented
    in the beautiful specimens of pottery from Sikyatki,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> possibly
    for the simple reason that there are no streams containing fish in
    the neighborhood of Hopi ruins. In the Mimbres, however, fish are
    still found and were no doubt formerly abundant and well known to the
    prehistoric inhabitants,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> being looked upon by them as water symbols
    in much the same way as the frog is at present regarded by Zuñi and Hopi.</p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/i047.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30.</span>—Fish. Oldtown Ruin. Diam. 9″.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Another fish figured on a bowl from Oldtown, is unfortunately broken
    near the tail. The accompanying decoration has apparently another
    figure behind this fish, but its complete form is obscured by the
    perforation made in killing the vessel.</p>

  <p>The most problematical of all the life figures on the Mimbres pottery
    is shown in <a href="#i07_2">plate 7, figure 2</a>. This figure occurs on a black and white
    food bowl, eleven inches in diameter, four and one-half inches in
    depth. In support of the theory that the two figures here depicted
    represent fishes, we have the pointed head without neck, the operculum
    as a white crescentic design, two fins (pectoral, ventral, and anal),
    the median (adipose?) dorsal fin unpaired, and a long tail bifurcated
    at the extremity. The resemblance of these figures to the undoubted
    fishes on bowls previously mentioned is conclusive evidence that they
    represent the same animal.</p>

  <h4>GEOMETRICAL FIGURES</h4>

  <p>The geometrical designs on Mimbres pottery are rectangular, curved, and
    spiral, the first form being the most common. These units are arranged
    in twos or fours, and although they consist often of zigzag or stepped
    figures, the triangle and rectangle predominate. The geometrical
    designs are rarely colored, but commonly filled in with hachures
    and parallel lines. There are seldom decorations on the outside of
    the Mimbres bowls, in which respect they differ from ancient Hopi
    (Sikyatki) vessels elsewhere figured.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Conversely, that part of the
    interior of the bowl which surrounds the central design, oftentimes
    elaborately ornamented in Mimbres pottery, is very simply <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>decorated in
    Sikyatki pottery. Encircling lines on Mimbres pottery are continuous,
    whereas at Sikyatki they are broken at one or more points by intervals
    known as the "life gateways" or "lines of life."<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> The geometrical
    figures on the inside of every bowl sometimes surround a central region
    on which no figures of animals or human beings are drawn, but which is
    perforated.</p>

  <p>The more strikingly characteristic forms of geometrical figures are
    shown in designs on <a href="#i0p8">plate 8</a>. Certain of the geometrical figures drawn
    on the sides of animals as on the wolf (<a href="#i02_1">pl. 2, fig. 1</a>), the antelope
    (figs. <a href="#i019">19</a> and <a href="#i020">20</a>), the mountain sheep (<a href="#i02_2">pl. 2, fig. 2</a>), the unidentified
    animal and bird (figs. <a href="#i018">18</a> and <a href="#i023">25</a>), the reptile (<a href="#i028">fig. 28</a>), also appear
    without the animals and probably have the same significance<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> in both
    instances.</p>

  <figure class="figcenter illowp78" id="i031">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i049.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>—Rabbit and geometrical designs.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>No geometrical figures were identified as representing sun, moon,
    earth, or rain-clouds. A few crosses, circles, triangles, and
    irregular quadrilateral designs combined with zigzag stepped figures
    and interlocked spirals and highly interesting swastikas (<a href="#i031">fig. 31</a>)
    form the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>majority of the designs.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Several geometric designs, as
    those on the bodies of figures <a href="#i023">25</a> and <a href="#i026">26</a>, appear on Sikyatki pottery
    (see 17th Ann. Rep. Bur. Amer. Ethnol., plate 121); others resemble
    Pueblo symbols of wide distribution, but the majority are unique. The
    geometric designs on the bodies of life-figures vary with the animal
    depicted, but the same genus of animals does not always have the
    geometric figure, although almost identical designs occur on the bodies
    of different genera. It is recognized that a comparison of designs on
    Southwestern pottery shows a general uniformity in geometrical pattern
    which renders it very difficult to distinguish different local areas
    of development, and may be the result of more extensive interchange of
    ideas and a greater uniformity of cultural conditions. The pottery of
    the Mimbres shares with the rest of the Southwest several well-known
    geometrical designs which no doubt date back to an earlier epoch than
    the evolution of animal figures, but it also has several decorations
    of geometrical patterns (<a href="#i032">fig. 32</a>) that are peculiar to it and which,
    taken with the characteristic zoic figures, serve to differentiate it
    from other local areas. Mimbres pottery as pointed out by others has
    a general likeness to that from Casas Grandes Valley in Chihuahua,
    a resemblance which no doubt increases as we follow the river to
    Lakes Palomas and Guzman.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> The resemblance is not close <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>enough to
    indicate identity, but we have enough material to support the belief
    that the archeological area in which it occurs is Mexican, unlike that
    of any other ceramic area in Arizona or New Mexico. Here a specialized
    symbolism has been developed which is different from that of the Rio
    Grande, or the Upper Gila-Salt area, and that characteristic of the
    great Lower Gila in which lie the compounds like Casa Grande. The
    Mimbres Valley archeologically is the northern extension of a culture
    area which reached its highest development on Casas Grandes River.</p>

  <h3><span class="smcap">Conclusions</span></h3>

  <p>Geographically the Mimbres Valley is the northern extension of the
    drainage area of the large interior plateau, the lowest level of which
    is occupied by Palomas, Guzman, and other so-called lakes. The Casas
    Grandes, Mimbres, and other rivers contribute their scanty waters to
    these lakes, which have no outlets into the sea. As a rule the thirsty
    sands along the course of the river drink up the surplus waters of
    the Mimbres or cause them to sink beneath the surface, to reappear
    when the configuration of lower clay or rock formations forces them
    from subterranean courses. Considering the similarity in climatic and
    geographical conditions in the northern and southern ends of this
    plateau, we would expect to find cultural likenesses in the prehistoric
    inhabitants of the Mimbres and Casas Grandes valleys, but such is not
    the case. The absence of relief decoration combined with painting, so
    common in the pottery from the Casas Grandes region, separates the
    Mimbres ware from that found far to the south.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

  <p>There are evidences that the course of the Mimbres River through
    Antelope Plain has from time to time changed considerably, and although
    a section of its bed now lies east of the Florida Mountains, the river
    probably formerly made its way to the west of the same in its course to
    Mexico. Modifications or changes in the bed of this river have had in
    the past much to do with the shifting of population and obliteration
    of prehistoric sites, either by washing them away entirely or burying
    them out of sight or deeply below the surface. This concealment of
    evidences of prehistoric occupancy has also been aided by frequent
    sandstorms, when considerable quantities of soil have been transported
    from place to place and deposited on walls or covered implements lying
    on the surface of the ground. It is also <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>possible that there has been
    a slow change of climate, causing a desiccation which may have been so
    widespread that the inhabitants of the plain were driven up river into
    the hills where water was more abundant, but it is well to remember
    that abandoned settlements or ruins exist on the banks of the Mimbres
    where there is still abundant water, as well as in the plain which is
    dry.</p>

  <p>The depth of the present water level, as shown by drilling for wells,
    varies in different places in the valley, but in the neighborhood of
    the hills there are many springs. The configuration of the surface
    of the hard clay strata lying beneath the soil here and there often
    forces the water to rise to the surface, and ruins occur at points
    where at present there are no signs of surface water, although at the
    time they were inhabited there may have been more water.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> Whether or
    not this water was brought to certain ruins by a system of artificial
    irrigation, the canals of which have been obliterated, we cannot say,
    but there is only scanty evidence that the climate here, as elsewhere,
    has radically changed since man occupied the valley.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

  <p>Although there is a remote likeness between the terraced house or
    pueblo community of northern New Mexico<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> and the prehistoric houses
    of the Lower Mimbres, its closest resemblance is to an antecedent type,
    for it is possible that the terraced pueblo culture in the Rio Grande
    Valley was preceded by another. This earlier type of habitation of
    the Mimbres Valley was like the fragile-walled house of the natives
    inhabiting a large part of Arizona and New Mexico before the Puebloan,
    and we have evidence that this older style of building was scattered
    over the present Pueblo area. There is no evidence of a terraced
    dwelling or pueblo more than one story high <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>in the Mimbres or the
    inland basin in which it lies. In other words the ruins of the Mimbres
    may be regarded as older than true pueblo ruins, resembling an earlier
    type of dwelling that antedated, in the Rio Grande Valley, the terraced
    houses.</p>

  <p>The author does not find any architectural features in the remains
    of the prehistoric habitations of the Mimbres Valley suggesting
    Casa Grande compounds, or those massive buildings with encircling
    walls which are characteristic of the plains of the Gila. Although
    the walls of the Casas Grandes, in Chihuahua, are constructed in
    the same way and out of material like those of Casa Grande on the
    Gila, the architectural feature, an encircling wall of the latter,
    has not yet been recognized on the Sierra Madre plateau.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Objects
    found in the Gila ruins are somewhat different in form from those of
    Chihuahua, while pottery from the Gila Valley ruins and that from the
    inland plateau in northern Chihuahua is markedly different, with very
    divergent symbolism. Not only do forms of stone implements of a shape
    unknown in southern Arizona occur in southern New Mexico, but also
    the methods of disposal of the dead differed among the two people.
    The latter practised inhumation only, the other both cremation and
    inhumation. The aborigines of the Mimbres Valley placed a bowl over
    the head or face of the dead, a practice which, so far as known, does
    not appear to have been so commonly in vogue in inhumation of the
    prehistoric people of the Lower Gila plains.</p>

  <p>The conventional geometric symbols on prehistoric Mimbres pottery are
    readily distinguished from those on ware from Tulerosa, a tributary
    of the San Francisco. The most significant feature of the Mimbres
    pottery is that fifty per cent of the figures on it represent men or
    animals, while out of a hundred bowls from the Gila not more than two
    or three are ornamented with zoic designs. As we know comparatively
    nothing of the pottery of the sources of the Upper Gila and that part
    of its course which lies between the Tulerosa and the Mimbres, we can
    at present venture very little information on ceramic relations, but
    similarities or mixtures would naturally be expected, due to contact or
    overlapping, the type of the one valley overlaying that of the other or
    mingling with it.</p>

  <p>The sources of the Upper Salt, the largest tributary of the Gila, lie
    far from the Mimbres, and close relationship in the pottery of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>ancient people inhabiting its banks is not found or expected. It is
    not known whether the pottery from the Upper Salt and that from the
    Upper Gila is similar, for our museums have no extensive collections
    from the latter region from which to make comparisons and draw
    conclusions. We know practically nothing of the prehistoric culture of
    the Upper Gila.</p>

  <p>The aborigines of the Mimbres, like those of some of the former
    dwellers in Pajarito Park in New Mexico, practised a modified form of
    urn burial, but the latter rarely decorated their pottery with figures
    of animals. As compared with known Pueblo ceramics, the Mimbres pottery
    appears to be more closely allied to ancient Keresan than to old Tewan.
    Judging from what remains, the houses architecturally had little in
    common with true pueblos.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> There are no evidences of circular
    subterranean kivas with pilasters, ventilators, deflectors, and niches,
    as in northern New Mexico, although there is a fairly large proportion
    of subterranean rooms or pit dwellings which may have been their
    prototypes. Architecturally the prehistoric habitations of the Mimbres
    Valley represent an old house form widely distributed in the Pueblo
    region or that antedating the pueblo or terraced-house type before the
    kiva had developed.</p>

  <p>There are not sufficient data at hand to determine satisfactorily the
    kinship of the prehistoric inhabitants of Mimbres Valley, but as far as
    may be judged by pottery symbols it may be supposed that their culture
    resembled that of other sedentary people of New Mexico and Arizona in
    early times, as well as that of peoples of Chihuahua. It appears to the
    author that there are so many cultural similarities among the sedentary
    people which inhabited the Sierra Madre plateau, of which the Antelope
    Plain of Mimbres Valley is only a northern extension, that we may
    regard their culture as closely related. A specialized high development
    of this inland culture took place along the Casas Grandes River,
    culminating in Chihuahua. The Mimbres Valley was inhabited by people
    somewhat less developed in culture.</p>

  <p>Although the ancients of the Mimbres were related on the one side to
    the Pueblos of New Mexico and on the other to more southern people,
    that relationship existed between the ancestors of the same rather than
    with modern Pueblos, and reached back to a time before <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>the terraced
    communal house type originated. This type of house arose in northern
    New Mexico and spreading from this center extended down the San Juan
    as far as the Hopi, while modifications are also found in certain
    ruins on the Gila and Little Colorado, which, like Zuñi, it profoundly
    influenced, but its influence never reached as far as the Lower Mimbres.</p>

  <p>A comparison of the limited archeological material from the Mimbres
    with that from other localities in the Southwest suggests a provisional
    hypothesis that the prehistoric culture of this valley was not modified
    by terraced architecture nor greatly affected by that of the Lower Gila
    type, both of which evolved independently and locally, but belonged to
    an older type with which it had much in common.</p>

    The Santa Rita mines early attracted the conquistadors
    looking for gold, and were worked in ancient times by the Spaniards,
    the ores obtained finding an outlet along a road down the valley to the
    city of Chihuahua. The prehistoric people also mined native Mimbres
    copper, and probably obtained from these mines and from those in Cook's
    Range, the native copper from which were made the hawk-bells sometimes
    found in Arizona and New Mexico. From these localities also were
    derived fragments of float copper often found in Southwestern ruins
    and commonly ascribed to localities in Mexico. From here came also a
    form of primitive stone mauls used in early days of the working of the
    mines.

    On some of the skulls excavated at Sikyatki, Arizona,

    States" (Amer. Anthrop., vol. 6, No. 5), Mr. Clarence B. Moore, quoting
    his own observations and those of many others, records burials in which

    A significant feature in the Mimbres form of "urn burial"
    is the invariable puncturing of the bowl inverted over the head. The
    ancient Peruvians in some instances appear to have "killed" their
    mortuary bowls, and life figures depicted on Peruvian pottery are
    sometimes arranged in pairs as in the Mimbres.

    geometrical design is attached to an animal figure which leads to the
    belief that possibly the figure attached to the rear of the above may
    not represent a part of another animal but rather a geometrical design
    of unknown significance, in this particular recalling old time Hopi
    ware.

    A picture of a horned toad on a food bowl was recorded

    Of all the designs representing the horned snake known
    to the author this picture from the Mimbres resembles most closely the
    pictures of this being on pottery from Casas Grandes. It has, however,
    the single horn found on the clay image in the Hano altar of the Winter
    Solstice Ceremony, although quite unlike figures on pottery from the
    Pajarito region. The bodily decorations in the Mimbres bowl are unlike
    those of the Hopi horned snake.

    The Mimbres formerly had many more fishes than at
    present, and Bartlett records that his men often brought in fine trout
    for his camp. These, with turkeys, quail, deer and antelopes, led him

    Ceremonially, every piece of pottery is supposed by the
    Hopi to be a living being, and when placed in the grave of the owner,
    it was broken or killed to let the spirit escape to join the spirit of
    the dead in its future home. There is no evidence that the Sikyatki
    mortuary pottery was purposely broken when deposited in the grave, and
    probably no need of perforating it to allow free exit of the spirit,
    for the broken encircling line, "life gateway," absent in Mimbres
    pottery, but almost universally present in ancient Hopi pottery,
    answered the same purpose, in their conception.

  <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">[55]</a>
    Following Hopi analogies, where these geometrical figures

    As the author has pointed out in several articles, the
    abandonment of Southwestern ruins is due to a variety of causes,
    chief of which are changes of climate. It is often due to other more
    local causes, as attacks by hostiles, salinity of soil, poor site for
    defence, presence of wizards, contagious diseases, etc.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_61" href="#FNanchor_61" class="label">[61]</a>
    The designation "pueblo ruins" sometimes applied to any
    cluster of ancient house walls in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and
    Arizona, should be restricted to a well-defined architectural type
    which originated and reached its highest development in a small area in
    New Mexico. It was eventually carried by colonists in all directions
    from the center of origin, becoming intrusive as far west as the Hopi,
    Zuñi, and Little Colorado. The boundaries of this type never extended
    into Mexico in prehistoric times. The ruins along the Mimbres are not
    community houses of terraced character and should not be called pueblo
    ruins.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_62" href="#FNanchor_62" class="label">[62]</a>
    This statement is made with reservation, as the true
    architectural form of the Casas Grandes of Chihuahua is not yet known.
    The published plans show no encircling wall like that of Casa Grande on
    the Gila; probably the Casas Grandes of Chihuahua belong to a highly
    specialized type different from others.
  </div>

  <div class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_63" href="#FNanchor_63" class="label">[63]</a>
    While neither the terraced nor the "compound" type of
    architecture has been seen in the Mimbres for the reason that both were
    specialized in their distinct geographical areas, the fragile-walled,
    jacal type of habitation is identical in form, though not in time, in
    all three localities.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
